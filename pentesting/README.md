# Frida Server Setup and Usage Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to download Frida Server, install Python requirements from a `requirements.txt` file, and use ADB (Android Debug Bridge) with a rooted Android emulator to execute a Frida `main.py` Python script.

## 1. Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A computer running a supported operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).
- Python 3.x installed on your computer.
- A rooted Android emulator or physical Android device with USB debugging enabled.
- A working installation of ADB on your computer.
- Frida Server compatible with your Android version.

## 2. Downloading Frida Server
1. Visit the official Frida GitHub releases page: [https://github.com/frida/frida/releases](https://github.com/frida/frida/releases).

2. Download the appropriate Frida Server binary for your Android version. Make sure to choose the correct architecture (e.g., `arm`, `arm64`, `x86`, or `x86_64`) and download the `frida-server` binary.

3. Place the downloaded `frida-server` binary in a directory of your choice on your computer.

## 3. Installing Python Requirements
1. Navigate to the directory where you have your `main.py` script and the `requirements.txt` file.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to that directory.

3. Run the following command to install the required Python packages using pip:
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This command will install all the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## 4. Setting up ADB
1. Ensure that you have ADB installed on your computer. You can download ADB from the Android SDK platform tools.

2. Verify that ADB is installed correctly by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   adb version
   ```

   You should see the version information for ADB.

3. Connect your rooted Android emulator or physical Android device to your computer using a USB cable.

4. Enable USB debugging on your Android device or emulator:
   - Go to **Settings** > **About phone** (or **About tablet**) > **Software information**.
   - Tap on the **Build number** multiple times (usually 7 times) until you see a message that says you are now a developer.
   - Go back to the main **Settings** screen, and you should see a new option called **Developer options**. Open it and enable **USB debugging**.

## 5. Using a Rooted Emulator
If you are using an Android emulator, ensure it is rooted to allow Frida to inject scripts into applications.

## 6. Executing the Frida `main.py` Script
1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your `main.py` script is located.

2. Start the Frida Server on your Android device or emulator using ADB. Replace `<path_to_frida_server>` with the actual path to the `frida-server` binary you downloaded in step 2:

   ```bash
   adb push <path_to_frida_server> /data/local/tmp/frida-server
   adb shell chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/frida-server
   adb shell /data/local/tmp/frida-server &
   ```

3. Verify that the Frida Server is running successfully by running the following command:

   ```bash
   adb shell ps | grep frida-server
   ```

   You should see a process with the name `frida-server` in the output.

4. Execute your Frida `main.py` script using Python:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Replace `main.py` with the actual name of your Python script.

5. Your script should now interact with the target application on the Android device or emulator using Frida.

That's it! You've successfully set up Frida Server, installed Python requirements, and executed a Frida script on your rooted Android emulator or device using ADB. You can now start developing and testing your Frida-based applications.

```bash
    adb install ..\MyEnchantedGarden\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk
```
